# Professional BSIT Graduate Portfolio Website

## Design Direction
- **Color Palette**: Deep navy (`#1a1a2e`) + electric blue (`#0ea5e9`) accent + clean whites and soft grays — tech-inspired, professional, and modern
- **Typography**: Inter (headings) + Inter or system sans-serif (body) — clean, highly readable
- **Style**: Minimalist with purposeful whitespace, subtle fade-in animations on scroll, smooth section transitions
